      <title>Developing an open-source toolset to improve landscape connectivity planning</title>

&lt;p&gt;Landscape connectivity is a vital component of biodiversity conservation as it facilitates the movement of individuals and genes between habitat patches to help maintain populations and metapopulations and increase persistence of species faced with global change. As land-use change and habitat fragmentation are a growing threat to native ecosystems across the globe, preserving landscape connectivity is a pressing issue for conservation biologists. With the current rate of global change and lack of resources for conservation, prioritization of which habitats and corridors should be conserved to promote maximum landscape connectivity for species persistence is necessary to most efficiently enact effective management plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Species Distribution Models (SDMs) are used to map areas across a landscape that are suitable for species presence, and landscape resistance models identify functional connectivity by mapping paths that support movement and gene flow between habitat patches. Many studies have found that SDMs are not very useful in predicting the matrix permeability and subsequent functional connectivity among patches. On the other hand, landscape resistance models do not provide any information on the habitat quality and species abundance at each patch, while numerous studies have found that high suitability predicted by SDMs corresponds well with high abundance. Therefore, SDMs and landscape resistance models complement each other well in these respects and should be used synergistically for corridor planning. To facilitate the use of both models, my goal is to develop an open-source toolset in the form of an R package that integrates SDM and landscape resistance model outputs to calculate corridor importance in terms of the level of movement it supports combined with the size and quality of habitats it connects (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;conceptFig.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Conceptual Figure&#34;&gt; &lt;em&gt;Figure 1. Conceptual design where A) represents a landscape resistance map in which thicker lines represent higher levels of movement, B) represents an SDM output showing patches of suitable habitat, and C) is the result of combining A) and B), where darker colors represent more importance to landscape connectivity in terms of the amount of movement the corridor supports and the quality of habitat it connects.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While numerous studies have used both methods in a conservation context, currently there is no easy way to integrate the two methods, particularly for corridor prioritization. While there are several other software programs that can perform habitat connectivity analyses, some of these programs are not freely available and there is no tool that performs all these calculations in a single platform. The advantage of collating all these steps into a single R package is that the software is free, the entire process from pre-processing of input files to final map presentation is easily reproducible, and the process can be automated over numerous species, places, or time frames, which is not offered by the other software programs. The R programming language is one of the fastest growing coding languages, particularly for ecologists. As a publicly available and easy to execute package, this new toolset will expand the applicability of SDMs and landscape resistance models in addressing conservation issues and improve habitat patch and corridor prioritization, which is a vital step to effectively preserving biodiversity.

&lt;p&gt;South Florida is home to the world&amp;rsquo;s largest community of introduced lizard species, with established populations of 43 different species. This community is a great example of the novel ecosystems concept, serving as a test case for how these novel systems operate, particularly how species disperse throughout a new habitat. As invasions become more common as a result of globalization, research on non-native populations is essential to inform managers on the best practices to prevent or reduce negative impacts on native ecosystems. To understand mechanisms of dispersal of these non-native lizard species, I am conducting a landscape genomics study, using next-gen sequencing to detect the relationship between environmental factors and spatial genetic structure, such as the factors that influence dispersal and persistence of the species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my study I am focusing on two large predatory lizards that, due to their generalist diets and large adult body size, likely impact native ecosystems but are poorly studied in their non-native range. These species are &lt;em&gt;Agama picticauda&lt;/em&gt;, a rock specialist from sub-Saharan Africa, and &lt;em&gt;Basiliscus vittatus&lt;/em&gt;, a riparian specialist from Central and South America. These species were both introduced in Miami in the 1970s and now occur all throughout Miami-Dade County. Utilizing an individual-based sampling approach, I have collected about 50 individuals of each species:
